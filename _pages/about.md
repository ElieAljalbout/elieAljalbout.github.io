I am a robotics researcher at Meta FAIR working on latent action modeling and world models for robotic manipulation. Prior to joining Meta, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Robotics and Perception Group](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/) in Zurich, Switzerland working on world modeling and reinforcement learning for agile robots. I completed my PhD at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and spent a couple of years as a researcher at the [Volkswagen Group, ML Research Lab](https://argmax.ai/). My research focus is at the intersection of machine learning, robotics and computer vision. I am particularly interested in foundation models for robotics/embodied AI, general agents, robotic manipulation and robot learning in general.
